# expense-tracking-app

# About

This appplication was built completely independently, no tutorial. I saw a demonstration version of a expense tracker to get a reference point of some of the feautures I would try and implement, and the rest I draw from my current tool kit. 

The intention was to apply some of the skills I've been learning throughout my JavsScript course. And strengthen my problem solving skills and utilise google to a greater affect.
